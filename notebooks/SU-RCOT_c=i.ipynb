    "This notebook starts from an exemplary supply-use table (SUT) that features fewer commodities than industries (c>i). The cases of [c=i](./SU-RCOT_c=i.ipynb) and [c>i](./SU-RCOT_c+i-.ipynb) are illustrated in separate notebooks. All notebooks share the same basic structure. That is, an illustrative SUT is imported from a spreadsheet; solved for the cases of factor constraints being absent or present; solved when new technologies are introduced; and compared to a solution relying on constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the RCOT models allow for many degrees of freedom, certain aspects are highlighted only for either of the three SUT setups. For example, the issue of monetary or mixed commodity data is illustrated only in the [c=i](./SU-RCOT_c=i.ipynb) notebook. The overlapping parts, however, are explained in detail here and only briefly sketched out for the other two setups. Here, for the most part, we will look at the coefficient formulations of the RCOT models.\n",
